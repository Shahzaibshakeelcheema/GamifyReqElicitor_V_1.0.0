## Gamified Requirement Gathering Tool (Built on MERN)

The Gamified Requirement Gathering Tool is a powerful web application designed to streamline the process of capturing and documenting requirements for projects. This tool incorporates gamification techniques to enhance user engagement and productivity. It is built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, offering a modern and scalable solution for requirement management.

### Three Key Roles

1. **Project Manager**: The Project Manager oversees the entire requirement gathering process, ensuring effective collaboration between the Requirement Engineer and the User. They have the authority to review and approve requirements, making critical decisions to ensure project success.

2. **Requirement Engineer (RE)**: The Requirement Engineer plays a vital role in verifying the feasibility and accuracy of the requirements provided by the User. They thoroughly analyze and validate each requirement, communicating with the User for clarification if necessary. If the Requirement Engineer approves the requirements, they are then forwarded to the Project Manager for final approval.

3. **User**: The User is the primary stakeholder who provides the initial set of requirements. Through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, they can submit their requirements to the system. Upon receiving feedback from the Requirement Engineer, the User has the opportunity to modify and resubmit their requirements. Furthermore, the User earns points or scores for each approved requirement, encouraging active participation in the requirement gathering process.

### Gamification Techniques

The Gamified Requirement Gathering Tool harnesses the power of gamification to incentivize and motivate its users. By introducing points or scores for active involvement, the tool encourages users to actively participate in the process. Users receive points for submitting requirements, while Requirement Engineers earn points when their verified requirements are accepted by the Project Manager. These points not only foster healthy competition but also provide a measurable metric to evaluate user performance and contribution.

### Streamlined Requirement Documentation

Upon successful approval from the Project Manager, the system generates a well-formatted requirement document. This document consolidates all approved requirements, ensuring clear and concise communication between stakeholders. By automating this process, the Gamified Requirement Gathering Tool reduces the likelihood of errors and misinterpretations, improving overall project efficiency.

### Conclusion

The Gamified Requirement Gathering Tool offers an innovative approach to requirement management, combining the power of the MERN stack with gamification techniques. With its intuitive interface, clear role-based workflows, and automated documentation generation, this tool revolutionizes the way requirements are captured, validated, and documented. Embrace the power of gamification and enhance your requirement gathering process with this robust and user-centric tool.
